Implicative dilemmas appear in one third of the non-clinical group (n = 321) and in about half of the clinical group (n = 286), the latter having a proportion of dilemmas that doubles that of the non-clinical sample. Within the clinical group, we studied 87 subjects, after completing a psychotherapy process, and found that therapy helps to dissolve those dilemmas. We also studied, independently, a group of subjects diagnosed with social phobia (n = 13) and a group diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (n = 13) in comparison to non-clinical groups. In both health related problems, dilemmas seem to be quite relevant. Altogether, these studies, though preliminary (and with a small group size in some cases), yield a promising perspective to the unexplored area of the role of cognitive conflicts as an issue to consider when trying to understand some clinical conditions, as well as a focus to be dealt with in psychotherapy when dilemmas are identified.},

	abstract = {Objectives The way that individuals perceive themselves and others may be relevant in understanding difficulties with self-harm. Repertory grids provide a relatively underutilized means of investigating self-concept in people who self-harm. This study aimed to examine the association between self-concept, captured through a repertory grid method, and self-harm. Method Ninety-eight participants with a history of self-harm took part in the study. A repertory grid was used to derive distances between four elements (‘current self’, ‘ideal self’, ‘self-harming self’, and ‘others who self-harm’). Associations between these distances and measures of self-harm behaviour, well-being and perceived recovery, were estimated. Results Repertory grid distances were significantly associated with self-harm. When adjusting for covariates, self-harm in the past year was positively associated with a greater distance (or less perceived similarity) between current and ideal self, and a smaller distance (greater perceived similarity) between current self and others who self-harm. Repertory grid distances were also associated with well-being and perceived recovery. Conclusions The results are consistent with the idea that self-perception is associated with self-harm and related difficulties. The results also highlight the potential utility of repertory grids as a tool for exploring self-concept. The cross-sectional nature of the study precludes inferences about directionality or the temporal characteristics of associations. Practitioner points More recent experiences of self-harm may be reflected in the way individuals perceive or construe themselves. The way in which individuals who self-harm perceive or construe themselves may also be related to their current well-being and perceived recovery. Repertory grids may be a useful tool in clinical practice for investigating self-concept in those who self-harm. Repertory grids may provide a more idiographic, clinical outcome assessment in those who self-harm.},

	abstract = {This paper presents and illustrates Interpretive Clustering, an innovative and original method of qualitative analysis of Repertory Grid data. Repertory Grids are a popular and flexible method of research, but they have primarily been used to gather data that are analysed quantitatively. Although many researchers have used Grids more qualitatively, this is often limited to a content analysis of the elicited constructs across a sample of participants. Interpretive Clustering is a participant-led method which uses the grid data idiographically to explore how a participant’s construing may ‘cluster’ around one or more issues. We show how this is quite different from a thematic analysis, and discuss how Interpretive Clustering can provide insights that are complementary to those gained from methods like thematic analysis. We conclude with suggestions for how this method, which we argue bridges the qualitative/quantitative divide, might be used in future research.},
